	<h3>Supply board applications</h3>
	
        <ul>
		<li>
		It can be used as a computer to hardware communication board.
		<b>supply</b> board itself has a number of interfaces which provide a huge 
		variability of applications. Besides that it's functionality can be expanded using 
		abitrary number of <b>extension boards</b>. The following interfaces are available 
		at the moment.
		<ul>
			<li>
				2 full (or 4 half) briges. Each can provide up to 600mA current constantly or 
				1200mA for a short time. (Extension boards have 4 full (8 half) bridges each.)
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Bright LED power source. Bright LED could be connected directly to appropriate 
				pins without current limiting resistors.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Trigger button input. This socket could be used for button connection. Board can 
				read button state and do something in the case of button is pressed.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				I2C master bus. Using it it is possible to control standard I2C devices like 
				accelerometers, magnetometers, humidity sensors, EEPROM chips and so on.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				I2C slave bus port. The board is equipt with I2C slave bus port. It could be attached to 
				another I2C bus and get commands through it.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Constant non controllable 3.3V step down converter which powers internal on board logic and 
				could also be used for powering external devices.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Programmable step down voltage converter. It could be used to make any voltage lower then 
				supply voltage. Available current range is 1650mA. Greater current is also available but 
				in this case current limiting functionality should be turned off.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Programmable step up voltage converter. It is capable to boost supply voltage to a value up to 20V.
				Similary to step down converter it's currrent range is limited to 1650mA and greater current is also 
				available if current limiting os off.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				PWM driver. Each extension board has 8 PWM outputs. Sockets are designed to be compatible with 
				analog servo motor socket standard. So system is capable to drive 8 X extension boards number servo 
				motors.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Analog to digital converter. Each extension board is equipt with 8 ADC inputs with range from 0V to 
				3.3V. Number of analog voltage measuring inputs could be multiplied by using more extension boards.
			</li>
		</ul>
