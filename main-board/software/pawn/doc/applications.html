	<h3>Supply board applications</h3>
	
        <ul>
		<li>
		It can be used as a computer to hardware communication board.
		<b>supply</b> board itself has a number of interfaces which provide a huge 
		variability of applications. Besides that it's functionality can be expanded using 
		abitrary number of <b>extension boards</b>. The following interfaces are available 
		at the moment.
			<ul>
				<li>
					2 full (or 4 half) briges. Each can provide up to 600mA current constantly or 
					1200mA for a short time. (Extension boards have 4 full (8 half) bridges each.) 
					This functionality is scalable. One may use more motor controllers by attaching 
					more extension boards.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Bright LED power source. Bright LED could be connected directly to appropriate 
					pins without current limiting resistors.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Trigger button input. This socket could be used for button connection. Board can 
					read button state and do something in the case of button is pressed.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					I2C master bus. Using it it is possible to control standard I2C devices like 
					accelerometers, magnetometers, humidity sensors, EEPROM chips and so on.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					I2C slave bus port. The board is equipt with I2C slave bus port. It could be attached to 
					another I2C bus and get commands through it.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Constant non controllable 3.3V step down converter which powers internal on board logic and 
					could also be used for powering external devices.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Programmable step down voltage converter. It could be used to make any voltage lower then 
					supply voltage. Available current range is 1650mA. Greater current is also available but 
					in this case current limiting functionality should be turned off.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Programmable step up voltage converter. It is capable to boost supply voltage to a value up to 20V.
					Similary to step down converter it's currrent range is limited to 1650mA and greater current is also 
					available if current limiting os off.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					PWM driver. Each extension board has 8 PWM outputs. Sockets are designed to be compatible with 
					analog servo motor socket standard. So system is capable to drive 8 X extension boards number servo 
					motors.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Analog to digital converter. Each extension board is equipt with 8 ADC inputs with range from 0V to 
					3.3V. Number of analog voltage measuring inputs could be multiplied by using more extension boards.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Each extension board has 8 digital input pins. As usual this functionality could be scaled by using more 
					extension boards.
				</li>
				
				
			</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Board can be user as a universal voltage converter with relatively high output current. As far as it has both 
			step up and step down converters on board it is capable to convert any voltage to any and provide it as an output.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			The board can serve as universal battery charger. It can take unstabilized voltage from any voltage source and 
			return stabilized voltage in the range from 0V to 20V with possible limiting of input current to 1) not burn weak 
			supply and 2) use advanced battery charge algorithms with both current and voltage control.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			It can be used as extension board for popular Raspberry PI credit card sized computer. In this case the board is stacked 
			on Raspberry PI IO socket and occupies 6 pins. This has several bonus issues besides of just providing Raspberry with 
			hardware resources like motor control.
				<ul>
					<li>
						The board is capable to power Raspberry PI computer with stabilized 5V through it's step down 
						voltage converter.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						Raspberry PI current consumption is relatively high (for model B it is from 700mA to 1200mA).  The 
						boards gives an opportunity to save much power by keeping Raspberry PI off most of the time and 
						turning it on only when it is needed or by schedule..
					</li>
					
					<li>
						It is even possible to feed Raspberry PI computer with relatively small solar cell panel. In this case 
						the board can collect solar energy and accumulate it in a battery. And when necessary it can turn 
						Raspbery PI on and feed it from a battery using energy collected.
					</li>
				</ul>
		</li>
