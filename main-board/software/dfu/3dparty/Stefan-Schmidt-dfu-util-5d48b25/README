Dfu-util - Device Firmware Upgrade Utilities

Dfu-util is the host side implementation of the DFU 1.0 [1] specification of
the USB forum.

DFU is intended to download and upload firmware to devices connected over
USB. It ranges from small devices like micro-controller boards up to mobile
phones. With dfu-util you are able to download firmware to your device or
upload firmware from it.

Most tests have been done with the Openmoko Neo1973 and Freerunner so far but
other devices have been reported working and is being worked on.
